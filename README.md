# DiscordPackageParser
A lightweight application to parse the personal data packages sent to you by Discord upon request.

With this tool you can parse the personal data packages Discord sends you upon request, it shows everything from general information, to all messages you ever sent to all your friends and other relations, a great way to thoroughly get to know what Discord has on you.

## How to use
1. First you should install Java, preferably a newer version like Java 16 as the program looks strange on older Java versions, especially the industry standard of Java 8. You can download Java 16 [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot).
3. Then you should download the latest release of Discord Package Parser from [here](https://github.com/PlanetTeamSpeakk/DiscordPackageParser/releases/latest).
4. If you have not yet requested a data package from Discord, you should do so now. You can do this in the Discord client by going to `User settings` -> `Privacy & safety` -> `Request data package` (at the bottom of the page).  
  Discord sends a link to download the package to the e-mail address associated with your account, usually within a couple of days.
3. Then either put the package.zip file in the same folder as the Discord Package Parser jar file, or run the Discord Package Parser and then browse to the package.zip file, within a couple of seconds you should see a screen that shows you some general information and gives you the possibility to view a whole lot more.
